# Own Instagram

## Instagram like app written in Kotlin.

It uses [these](https://codingwithmitch.com/courses/instagram-clone/) lessons for building Instagram clone, but unlike these, it uses **MVP-architecture**, **Kotlin** programming language and many moments of that course were changed by myself.

For simplifying registration/authentication processes Firebase is used:
1. Firebase Authentication
2. Firebase Database
3. Firebase Cloud Store

Original Istagram-clone you can find [here](https://github.com/mitchtabian/Android-Instagram-Clone).
